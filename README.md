This plugin remembers where you left off in a file, restoring your cursor and viewport.

Vim can kind of do this already, so if you're looking for something simple, just read `:help last-position-jump`. It'll get you 90% of the way there.

What it *doesn't* do is restore your scroll position, a detail which finally got annoying enough that I wrote my own plugin. It uses `winsaveview()` under the hood.
